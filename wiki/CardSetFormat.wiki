#summary How to build a card set.

== Introduction ==

In ShoddyTCG, Databases are written in pure, raw XML. 
Due to the different card types that any given Pokemon Card can be, this guide will be split into several sections. 


== The Card Set ==

The Card Set XML must be placed in the res/sets folder, with a short name, like dp.xml, where dp is the set's codename. 

The following is a table with the Set's name and its Codename, ordered by release date. 
|| Set Name || Code ||
|| Diamond and Pearl || DP ||
|| Mysterious Treasures	|| MT ||
|| OP Series 6 || OP6 || 
|| Secret Wonders || SW ||
|| DP Trainer Kit 1 || TK3 ||
|| Great Encounters || GE ||
|| OP Series 7 || OP7 ||
|| Majestic Dawn || MD ||
|| Legends Awakened || LA ||
|| OP Series 8 || OP8 ||
|| Stormfront || SF ||
|| Platinum || PL ||
|| Rising Rivals || RR ||
|| OP Series 9 || OP9 ||
|| Supreme Victors || SV ||
|| Arceus || AR ||
|| DP Promos || NDP ||

A sample cardset is provided below.
