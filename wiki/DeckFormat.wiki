#summary Creating your own .deck file

= Introduction =

Every Pokemon deck must have exactly 60 cards under 'normal' tournament rules. 
Except for Basic Energies and Arceus, a player can only have up to 4 copies of any given card, based on its name. (This means 4 Pikachu, regardless of the set, although you can still add Lt. Surge's Pikachu or Flying Pikachu, because their card name is different). 

This guide should cover the basics of making a .deck file, which ShoddyTCG reads as your Pokemon deck.
